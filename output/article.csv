post-merger, a few quarters are always likely to be tough in terms of profitability and that could play out. The initial rally in

 as the merger got confirmed has played out now. From here, the bank may actually underperform the rest of the 
banking sector
 for some time.
 
What are your thoughts on 
PSU banks

The celebrated journalist serves as the spearhead for a critique of India's toxic broadcast ecosystem, whose cheerleading for the Bharatiya Janata Party government has created a cacophony of sycophancy, propaganda and hate-mongering.

During his 28-year stint at NDTV India, Kumar came to be regarded as a voice of sanity, intelligence and independence. The film contrasts Kumar's eloquent prime-time anchoring, explicit stand against religious polarisation and insistence on doing what journalism is meant to do – hold those in power to account – with the conduct of his competitors, who equate questioning authority with being 'anti-national'.",scroll.in,4297,news,IN,en,Nandini Ramnath,https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/191913-iqpvplgzvy-1688615181.jpeg,False,@TheReel_in,5.0308566,0e630b67ad585f1ec5140a6312a06a8b
